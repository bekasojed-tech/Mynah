    """Split one Whisper segment into per-speaker sub-blocks.

    Returns a list of ``(speaker, start_time, text)`` tuples — one per
    run of consecutive words that share the same speaker label. Used
    by the transcript writer to avoid the "one segment, many speakers"
    flattening problem: WhisperX puts per-word speaker labels under
    ``seg["words"][i]["speaker"]`` after ``assign_word_speakers``, but
    the segment-level ``seg["speaker"]`` collapses those into one
    label, so any speaker change inside a 10–30s Whisper segment gets
    misattributed.

    Fallbacks (each preserves the segment so the transcript line still
    makes sense, just with the coarse label we had before this split):

    - No ``words`` field, or empty / non-list: one block using
      ``seg_fallback_speaker`` + ``seg["text"]`` + ``seg["start"]``.
    - A word lacks a ``speaker`` field: inherit the previous word's
      speaker; if there is no previous word, use
      ``seg_fallback_speaker``.
    - Words have ``speaker`` but no ``start``: use ``seg["start"]`` for
      the first sub-block and keep the prior block's end-time as the
      next sub-block's start (Whisper's segment-level timestamps are
      always present even when word alignment was skipped).
