"""Discord RPC client with full OAuth (AUTHORIZE + AUTHENTICATE) flow.

Talks to Discord's local named pipe (\\\\.\\pipe\\discord-ipc-*) and exchanges
the AUTHORIZE code for an OAuth token at https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token.

Required scopes for participant tracking + speaking events: rpc,
rpc.voice.read, identify. The client_id must be a real Discord Application
ID. The user running this app must be listed as a tester on the Discord
developer portal application unless the app is publicly approved.

Threading model
---------------
After AUTHENTICATE succeeds, a background reader thread takes over the pipe
and dispatches each incoming frame either to:
  - a pending synchronous command (matched by nonce), or
  - a registered event listener (matched by evt name).

This is what lets us hold subscriptions (SPEAKING_START / SPEAKING_STOP /
VOICE_STATE_*) while still issuing synchronous queries.

Protocol opcodes
----------------
Discord IPC sends control frames in addition to FRAME (JSON command/event)
payloads. We MUST answer PING with PONG; without it Discord will sever the
pipe after a liveness timeout, which manifests as the recorder appearing to
"randomly stop connecting" after some idle minutes.

# Discord's own StreamKit Overlay (the OBS/XSplit browser source) is an
# approved RPC application. Its browser page authorizes against the local
# RPC server with the client id below and exchanges the resulting code at
# streamkit.discord.com, which holds the application secret server-side.
# Third-party overlays (e.g. Discover Overlay on Linux) have driven the
# same flow for years. In this mode Mynah needs no developer application,
# no Client ID and no Client Secret.
#
# The scope list mirrors what StreamKit itself requests, so the request
# looks exactly like the one Discord's own page sends. Mynah only ever
# exercises the `rpc` part (GET_SELECTED_VOICE_CHANNEL and the SPEAKING_* /
# VOICE_STATE_* subscriptions); the two read-only extras are never used.
#
# Trade-off: this presents Mynah to Discord under Discord's own
# application identity. Discord tolerates the open-source overlays doing
# this, but could stop honouring it at any time, and the only token
# refresh available is a fresh Authorize prompt (roughly weekly).

        Threat model
        ------------
        A same-user process (malware from an earlier compromise, another
        local app, a sandboxed plugin) races Discord at startup and
        creates one of the `discord-ipc-N` named pipes itself. Without
        this check the recorder sends OAuth codes and access tokens
        over the pipe to whoever opened it first.

        Defense in depth
        ----------------
        Two independent checks; BOTH must pass.

        1. Path allow-list (fast pre-filter, `_check_peer_image_path`):
           - Basename in `_DISCORD_PEER_BASENAMES`
           - Image path lives under a `_trusted_discord_install_roots`
             tuple (root + separator)
           Cheap; rejects obvious squatters before we pay the cost of
           the cryptographic check.

        2. Authenticode signature (real cryptographic check,
           `_verify_authenticode_signed_by_discord`):
           - Image is Authenticode-signed
           - Signature chains to a trusted root in the OS trust store
           - Signer Subject contains `Discord, Inc.`
           This is independent of the file path — a binary anywhere on
           disk that is genuinely Discord-signed will pass; a binary
           anywhere on disk that is NOT genuinely Discord-signed will
            fail, even if it was dropped into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Discord\\`
            (which is user-writable and was therefore the bypass surface
            a path-only check cannot close).

        Why the path check stays
        ------------------------
        After the signature check is in place, the path check is
        technically redundant for security. It is retained because (a)
        it produces faster, clearer error messages for the common
        misconfiguration cases (Discord not running, third-party process
        squatting the pipe) and (b) defence-in-depth limits the blast
        radius if the OS trust store is compromised at some point in
        the future.

        Resolution sequence
        -------------------
        1. `GetNamedPipeServerProcessId` resolves the server PID.
        2. `OpenProcess` with `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION` only
           (no `PROCESS_VM_READ`) — the minimum rights modern
           `QueryFullProcessImageName` needs. Avoids false-rejection
           against PPL/EDR-protected processes.
        3. `QueryFullProcessImageName` reads the canonical image path.
        4. `_check_peer_image_path` enforces the path allow-list.
        5. `_verify_authenticode_signed_by_discord` enforces the
           cryptographic check.

        Residual gaps
        -------------
        - PID-reuse race: between `GetNamedPipeServerProcessId` and
          `OpenProcess`, the original server can exit and the kernel
          can reuse the PID for an unrelated process. The window is
          small (sub-millisecond typical) AND the Authenticode check
          on the binary at the resolved path makes the window-exploit
          much harder (the attacker's binary would still have to be
          Discord-signed). We treat this as an acceptable residual race.

        - PowerShell availability: the Authenticode check shells out to
          PowerShell's `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`. PowerShell is part of
          every Windows install since Windows 7. If it is genuinely
          unavailable (locked-down systems, malformed PATH), we fail
          closed with a clear error rather than fall back to path-only
          (which is the bypassable check we're trying to supersede).

        Fails closed: any failure to resolve the peer raises `RpcError`.
