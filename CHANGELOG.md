# Changelog

All notable changes to Mynah are documented here.
This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **One folder per recording.** New recordings are saved as
  `Recordings\<meeting>_discord_<date>_<time> [<server> - <channel>]\`
  containing `audio.wav`, `participants.json`, and later `transcript.txt`
  / `mapping.json`, instead of four prefixed files side by side. The
  server and channel names are taken from Discord automatically (`[DM]`
  / `[Group DM - …]` for direct calls) and also recorded in
  `participants.json`; the Archive shows them as a tag on each row.
  Recordings made by earlier versions stay listed and transcribable
  where they are.
- **Rename recordings from the Archive.** Double-click a name (or click
  the pencil on the row) to edit the meeting name inline; Enter saves,
  Escape cancels. The date part is kept so ordering does not change.
  Names go through the same filename sanitiser as new recordings, name
  collisions are refused, and renaming is blocked while a transcription
  is running. Renaming an old flat-layout recording moves its files into
  a folder. The legacy Tk UI gets a **Rename…** button for the same.

- **StreamKit identity (default for new installs).** Discord now refuses
  the `rpc` OAuth scope for ordinary developer applications
  (`invalid_scope` before the Authorize prompt even appears), which made
  "create your own application" setups unable to connect at all. Mynah
  can instead authorize as Discord's own StreamKit Overlay application —
  the same flow the official OBS browser-source overlay and third-party
  overlays such as Discover use. No developer application, Client ID or
  Client Secret is needed; the authorization code is exchanged at
  `streamkit.discord.com`, so nothing goes to a third party. Settings
  gained a **Connect as** selector; the previous own-application flow
  remains available for users whose application Discord has approved.
  Existing installs that already carry a Client ID stay on the
  own-application flow until switched. StreamKit tokens cannot be
  refreshed, so Discord re-prompts for authorization roughly weekly.

### Fixed

- Restored Discord's documented local-RPC OAuth contract. The RPC
  `AUTHORIZE` command does not accept browser/Social-SDK PKCE or redirect
  arguments; token exchange therefore uses the application's Client Secret,
  stored in the OS credential manager rather than `config.json`.
- Stop requesting the partner-only `rpc.voice.read` scope from ordinary
  developer applications; Discord rejects it with `invalid_scope`. Base RPC
  remains enabled and speaker-event tracking falls back to audio diarization.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **One-click in-app updates** — the update dialog now offers **Update
  now** (alongside Later): the app downloads the new `MynahSetup.exe`
  from the GitHub release (sha256-verified against the release's
  checksum file, URLs locked to this repo's release assets), restarts
  into the installer's new `--update` mode — which re-runs only the
  steps whose pins changed, typically under a minute — and relaunches
  Mynah when done. Available on installer-based installs; dev checkouts
  and the standalone build keep the "Open download page" button.
  Updating is blocked while a recording or transcription is running.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **One-click installer (#9)** — every release now ships `MynahSetup.exe`
  (~11 MB): pick a folder, click Install. It downloads a self-contained
  Python runtime, detects your NVIDIA driver to choose CUDA or CPU
  PyTorch automatically, installs the full stack into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mynah`, and creates Start Menu / Desktop shortcuts.
  Interrupted installs resume (per-step state + HTTP range-resume on
  downloads). No Python, Git, or PowerShell required.
- App icon — window title bar, taskbar, shortcuts, and both `.exe`s now
  use the Mynah mark instead of default icons.
- `MYNAH_APP_ROOT` environment override for `app_root()`, used by the
  installer's launcher so `config.json` and `Recordings\` live in the
  install folder.
- Release workflow: pushing a version tag builds `MynahSetup.exe` on CI
  and attaches it (plus a SHA-256 checksum file) to the GitHub release.
- **Proper uninstall** — installer-based installs register in Windows
  "Apps & features"; uninstalling from there removes the app, shortcuts,
  and registry entry, with a prompt to keep or delete your recordings
  and settings.
- **Update notifications** — the app checks GitHub's releases API on
  launch (Settings toggle, on by default, documented in the README
  privacy section). A newer version shows an UPDATE badge in the top
  bar; clicking it shows the release notes and links to the download
  page. Settings also has a manual "Check now" button.

### Fixed

- Fatal-error dialog now falls back to the native Win32 message box when
  tkinter is unavailable (the installer's runtime ships without it).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Security: Discord OAuth migrated to PKCE (#1)** — the app no longer
  asks for, sends, or stores a Client Secret. The RPC `AUTHORIZE` now
  carries an S256 `code_challenge` + `state`, the token exchange and
  refresh prove possession of the `code_verifier` instead of a secret,
  and the Settings dialogs drop the Client Secret field. A secret stored
  by an older version is removed from the OS credential store on launch,
  and a plaintext one in a legacy `config.json` is discarded on load.
  **Setup change:** enable **Public Client** on your Discord
  application's OAuth2 tab (one-time); the "Reset Secret" step is gone
  from the README.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **New default UI** — a modern WebView2-based interface (pywebview) replaces
  the Tkinter window as the default: light/dark/system theme toggle, live
  recording timer, status LEDs, recordings list, streaming console pane, and
  in-window settings/consent dialogs. The frontend lives in `src/mynah/web/`;
  the Python side is split into `backend.py` (JS bridge / state machine) and
  `webui.py` (window lifecycle). The legacy Tk UI remains available via
  `--legacy-ui` and is the automatic fallback when pywebview or the WebView2
  runtime is missing.
- **`uicore.py`** — UI-toolkit-agnostic core (log scrubbing, atomic settings
  apply, consent attestation, recordings indexing) shared by both UIs;
  `gui.py` re-exports the original names so existing imports keep working.

### Fixed

- Silenced two benign-but-noisy startup warnings (#7): pyannote/torchcodec's
  "torchcodec is not installed correctly" UserWarning (the decoder path is
  dead code for Mynah) and Lightning's checkpoint auto-upgrade INFO on every
  transcription. Both suppressions are narrowly scoped to the exact
  message/logger.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-08

First public release.

### Highlights

- **Local-only audio capture** — Windows WASAPI loopback records your mic plus the system audio mix (so screen-shares, music, and every other participant's voice all get captured). No bot ever joins the Discord channel; nothing leaves your machine.
- **Ground-truth speaker labels from Discord** — Mynah subscribes to Discord's per-user `SPEAKING_START` / `SPEAKING_STOP` events over the local RPC named pipe. Transcript labels reflect who Discord says was actually speaking at each moment, not acoustic clustering. Heuristic diarization (pyannote) is the fallback for non-Discord apps or when SPEAKING events are missing.
- **WhisperX transcription with per-word alignment** — Whisper handles the speech-to-text; `whisperx.align()` lines up each word's timestamp with the speaker timeline, so the transcript splits at the right places when two people overlap.
- **Secrets in the OS credential store** — Discord OAuth tokens, the HuggingFace token, and the client secret are stored in Windows Credential Manager (or macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service on supported platforms). `config.json` carries only non-sensitive settings.
- **Recording consent gate** — Mynah displays a privacy attestation dialog before any audio capture begins. The attestation is recorded into the recording's `participants.json` for auditability.
- **Discord pipe peer verification** — The local Discord IPC pipe is verified against a trusted install root and an Authenticode signature check, so a same-user attacker can't squat the pipe and harvest tokens.
- **Standalone `.exe` build** — `start.ps1 -Build` produces `dist/Mynah/Mynah.exe` (PyInstaller, ~4 GB bundled with PyTorch + CUDA). The `.exe` runs without Python or Git on the target machine.
- **CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM + bundled-DLL manifest** — Every build emits an SBOM of the runtime dependency closure and a hash manifest of every native binary inside the bundle.

### System

- Windows 10 1903+ / Windows 11.
- NVIDIA GPU recommended (RTX 20-series or newer, ≥ 6 GB VRAM); CPU works but is ~10× slower than realtime.
- ~10 GB of disk for Python deps + Whisper weights; ~15 GB recommended.
- Python 3.10–3.13 for dev mode; not needed for the `.exe` build.
