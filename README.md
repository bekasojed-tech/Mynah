# Mynah

> **Record Discord voice calls and transcribe them locally with accurate per-speaker labels — no bot, nothing leaves your machine.**

![Mynah](docs/screenshot.png)

### Why Mynah

- **100% local.** Audio capture, transcription, and storage all happen on your machine. No cloud upload, no bot, no third-party service ever sees your call.
- **No bot joins the channel.** Mynah talks to your local Discord desktop client over a named pipe (the same one Spotify uses for "Listening to…"). Other participants see nothing.
- **Ground-truth speaker labels.** Mynah subscribes to Discord's own per-user `SPEAKING_START` / `SPEAKING_STOP` events — so transcript labels are correct by definition, not by acoustic clustering. Heuristic diarization is the fallback, not the default.

---

## Quick start (TL;DR)

### Just want the app? One-click installer

Download **`MynahSetup.exe`** from the
[latest release](https://github.com/ba1lly/Mynah/releases/latest) and run
it. No Python, Git, or PowerShell needed.

- The installer itself is ~11 MB. On first run it downloads the ML stack
  into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mynah` — ~2.5 GB with an NVIDIA GPU (it detects
  your driver and picks CUDA or CPU builds automatically), less for
  CPU-only.
- If the connection drops mid-install, just run it again — it resumes
  from the last completed step (the Python-runtime download also
  resumes mid-file; packages that already installed aren't
  re-downloaded).
- You get a Start Menu entry (and optional Desktop shortcut), and the
  install registers in Windows **Settings → Apps → Installed apps** —
  uninstall it from there like any other app (it asks whether to keep
  your recordings and settings).

Then do the 2-minute [Discord setup](#discord-setup) below.

### Working on the code? Dev bootstrap

```powershell
# Clone, enter the folder, run the bootstrap. The script creates the venv,
# installs everything that's missing, and launches the app.
git clone https://github.com/ba1lly/Mynah.git
cd Mynah
.\start.ps1
```

Re-run the same command any time you want to launch the app. It's idempotent
— second-time launches skip straight to the GUI in a couple of seconds.

First time only, the script will:

1. Create the `.venv` and install all Python deps (~3 GB of PyTorch + CUDA wheels).
2. Detect if PyTorch is missing, CPU-only, or the wrong version, and self-heal.
3. **Pre-download Whisper model weights** (~1.6 GB) to the Hugging Face cache
   so your first transcription doesn't have to wait. If you've already
   pasted an HF token in Settings, pyannote diarization weights are
   pulled too.

> **Deprecated:** `start.ps1 -Build` (the ~4 GB standalone bundle) is
> superseded by `MynahSetup.exe` above and will be removed in a future
> release ([#17](https://github.com/ba1lly/Mynah/issues/17)). It still
> works for now:
>
> ```powershell
> .\start.ps1 -Build
> ```

## Supported applications

Designed and tested for **Discord** voice channels (server channels and
1-on-1 / group DM calls). On Discord, speaker labelling uses **Discord's
own per-user `SPEAKING_START` / `SPEAKING_STOP` events as ground truth**
— we record who Discord says was speaking at each moment, so transcript
labels are correct by definition, not by heuristic.

The recording + transcription pipeline is generic, so other voice apps
technically work too — they just lose the ground-truth labels and fall
back to acoustic diarization:

| App | Audio capture | Speaker labels |
|---|:---:|:---|
| **Discord** (server channels, DMs, group DMs) | ✅ | ✅ ground-truth from Discord `SPEAKING_*` events |
| Zoom / Teams / Meet / Slack Huddles | ✅ | ⚠️ heuristic (pyannote clustering); names anonymous (`SPEAKER_00`, …) unless you edit the mapping JSON |
| Any browser/desktop call | ✅ | ⚠️ same as above |

For non-Discord apps you'd get a clean WAV and a transcript with
`SPEAKER_NN` labels — rename them manually in the `mapping.json` file
produced alongside the transcript.

## System requirements

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows 10 1903+ | Windows 11 | WASAPI loopback + named-pipe IPC. No Linux/Mac support. |
| **WebView2 Runtime** | — | — | Renders the UI; preinstalled on Windows 11 and current Windows 10. If it's genuinely missing the app falls back to a basic legacy UI ([download](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)). |
| **CPU** | Any 64-bit, last decade | Modern | The GPU does the heavy lifting during transcription. |
| **RAM** | 8 GB | 16 GB | Whisper `large-v3` peaks around 5 GB. |
| **GPU** | None (CPU works) | NVIDIA RTX 20-series or newer, 6 GB+ VRAM | CPU transcription is ~10× slower than realtime. NVIDIA only (CUDA). |
| **VRAM** | n/a if CPU mode | 3 GB for `large-v3`; less for `medium` / `small` / `base` | Model has to fit. |
| **Disk** | 10 GB free | 15 GB | PyTorch+CUDA (~5 GB), Whisper weights (~3 GB), recordings. |
| **Python** (dev mode) | 3.10 | 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13 | Skip if you're only using the built `.exe`. |
| **NVIDIA driver** | 552+ (mid-2024 or newer) | Latest via GeForce Experience | Required for CUDA 12.6 support. |
| **Network** | First-run only | — | ~3 GB of model + wheel downloads; everything else is local. |

The `.exe` build runs without Python or Git — those are only needed for the
dev launcher.

---

## What you need before first run

| Requirement | How to get it |
|---|---|
| **Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13** (dev mode only — skip if using the built `.exe`) | <https://www.python.org/downloads/> — tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during install |
| **Git** (dev mode only — WhisperX pip-installs from GitHub) | <https://git-scm.com/download/win> |
| **Discord desktop client running** (not the browser version) | — |
| **A Discord application** (see [Discord setup](#discord-setup) below) | One-time, free, ~2 min |
| **Hugging Face account + token** (optional — only for speaker-labelling in transcripts) | <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens> |

---

## Discord setup

The app uses Discord's local RPC (the same mechanism Spotify uses to show
"Listening to…"). The voice-channel query and the per-user speaking
events sit behind the `rpc` OAuth scope, which Discord only grants to
applications it has approved. **This is not a bot** — no bot token, no
Bot tab, nothing joins the channel.

### Default: the StreamKit identity (no setup)

Discord's own **StreamKit Overlay** (the OBS/XSplit browser source) is an
approved RPC application, and Mynah can authorize through it the same
way the StreamKit web page and third-party overlays such as
[Discover](https://github.com/trigg/Discover) do:

1. Launch the recorder and click **Connect to Discord**.
2. The Discord desktop app pops an **Authorize** prompt for *StreamKit
   Overlay* — accept it.

That's it. No developer application, Client ID or Client Secret. The
authorization code is exchanged at `streamkit.discord.com` (Discord's own
server), and the resulting access token lives in the **Windows Credential
Manager** (under `com.github.ba1lly.mynah`). StreamKit tokens have no
refresh token, so Discord re-shows the Authorize prompt roughly once a
week.

What you are agreeing to: Mynah presents itself to Discord under
Discord's StreamKit application identity. Discord has tolerated the
open-source overlays doing this for years, but it is not a documented
public API and Discord could stop honouring it at any time. If that
happens Mynah reports the error and transcription falls back to audio
diarization (which requires an HF token).

### Alternative: your own Discord application

Only worth it if Discord has approved **your** application for the `rpc`
scope (for example an older app that was whitelisted). For a freshly
created application Discord answers `invalid_scope` before the Authorize
prompt even appears, and no local setting can change that.

1. Open <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → **New Application**.
   Name it anything (e.g. "My Mynah"). Do **not** attach it to a Team —
   team-owned applications are refused RPC outright.
2. **OAuth2** tab → **Redirects** → add `http://localhost` → **Save Changes**.
3. **OAuth2** tab → turn **Public Client** off → **Save Changes**. Copy the
   **Client ID**, then click **Reset Secret** and copy the new **Client
   Secret**. Treat the secret like a password; do not post it in logs or chat.
4. If an **App Testers** tab appears on your application, add your own
   Discord user there.
5. In Mynah, open **Settings** (gear icon, top right), set **Connect as**
   to *My own Discord application*, paste the Client ID and Client Secret,
   then click **Save**.

Tokens, the Client Secret and the HF token all go to the Windows
Credential Manager — none of the secrets are written to `config.json`.
Mynah never requests the partner-only `rpc.voice.read` scope; the
speaking events it needs are covered by `rpc`.

---

## Hugging Face token (optional)

**For Discord recordings, speaker labels work without an HF token** —
the app uses Discord's own `SPEAKING_START` / `SPEAKING_STOP` events as
ground truth and maps them to usernames. So a Discord-only workflow needs
no HF token at all and your transcripts already look like:

```
[Alice] (00:00:05) Let's review Q2 metrics
[Bob]   (00:00:12) Linea TVL is up 15%
```

You only need an HF token when:

- You record audio from non-Discord sources (Zoom / Teams / Meet / browser
  calls), so the app must fall back to acoustic diarization via pyannote, OR
- A Discord recording somehow ends up without `speaking_events` (older
  recordings, a subscription failure mid-call). In that case the same
  pyannote fallback runs.

Without an HF token in those edge cases, transcripts come out unlabeled:

```
(00:00:05) Let's review Q2 metrics
(00:00:12) Linea TVL is up 15%
```

To enable speaker labels for non-Discord recordings:

1. Create an account at <https://huggingface.co>.
2. Accept the model licenses (one click each):
   - <https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1>
   - <https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0>
3. Generate a **Read**-scope token at
   <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>.
4. Paste it into **Settings → HF token**.

You can skip this and add it later — it only matters at transcription time.

---

## Day-to-day usage

1. Join a Discord voice channel.
2. Run `.\start.ps1` (or double-click the `.exe` once you've built it).
3. **Connect to Discord** → confirm participants show up in the
   **Transport** panel.
4. Optionally type a meeting name.
5. Click the round **record** button (a consent prompt appears first) →
   have your call → click **stop**.
6. The new recording auto-selects in the **Archive** list; click
   **Transcribe selected** when you're ready (this is the slow step —
   runs Whisper on your GPU).

The UI follows your system light/dark theme; cycle system → light →
dark with the toggle next to the settings gear. If you prefer the old
Tkinter interface, launch with `--legacy-ui`.

### Audio source

In **Settings → Audio source**, choose what to capture:

| Setting | What it records | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| **Mic + System** (default) | Your mic mixed with everything coming out of your speakers/headset | Real Discord meetings — captures you + everyone else |
| **Mic only** | Just your microphone | Solo voice memos; situations where you want to exclude system audio |
| **System only** | Speaker/headset output, no mic | Recording someone else's call audio without your own contributions |

For real meetings, leave this on **Mic + System**.

### Loopback device

By default the app captures whatever output Windows currently flags as
the default playback device (so audio that Discord plays through your
speakers/headset ends up on the right channel of the recording). If
Discord is routed to a different output — common when you have
multiple HDMI sinks or a separate headset on a USB dongle — open
**Settings → Loopback device** and pick the one that's actually
carrying Discord's audio. The dropdown lists every WASAPI loopback the
system exposes; duplicates (e.g. two HDMI sinks reporting the same
name) get a `(#N)` suffix and the current Windows default is tagged
`(Windows default)`. Leave it on `(Windows default playback)` if you
just want the legacy behaviour.

If the configured loopback later disappears (device unplugged), the
recorder falls back to the Windows default and logs a warning rather
than failing the recording.

Each meeting gets its own folder inside **`Recordings\`** next to the app
(change the location in Settings if you want them elsewhere). The folder
is named `<meeting name>_discord_<date>_<time> [<server> - <channel>]`,
for example `Standup_discord_20261002_023859 [Eunify - general]`. The
meeting name is optional (`discord_<date>_<time> [...]` when you leave it
empty); the server and channel are filled in automatically from Discord,
and a direct call shows `[DM]` or `[Group DM - <name>]` instead:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `audio.wav` | Channel-split mic + system audio, 48 kHz stereo 16-bit (L=mic, R=loopback when Audio Source is Mic + System) |
| `participants.json` | Initial roster, join/leave timeline, and the per-user `SPEAKING_START`/`SPEAKING_STOP` event log used for speaker labels |
| `transcript.txt` | Generated by **Transcribe selected** |
| `mapping.json` | Only written if any speakers couldn't be auto-mapped — rare on Discord (ground-truth labelling), more common for non-Discord recordings |

**Renaming:** in the Archive list, double-click a recording's name (or
use the pencil button on its row) to change the meeting name. Only the
name part of the folder changes; the date and the `[server - channel]`
block stay, so the list order and the date column are unaffected. Recordings made by older versions, which
stored the four files side by side as `…_audio.wav`, `…_participants.json`
and so on, keep working in place; renaming one of those gathers its files
into a folder in the new layout.

### When speaker auto-mapping needs manual help

On Discord, this almost never triggers — speaker labels come from
Discord's `SPEAKING_*` events, so every segment is mapped to the actual
speaker's username by definition.

It only kicks in for **non-Discord recordings** (or older Discord
recordings made before this feature shipped), where the fallback
acoustic-diarization path runs. Auto-mapping there works perfectly when
N participants = N speakers (matches by order of first speech). If 5
people were in the channel but only 3 spoke, the app can't know which 3.
You'll get a `mapping.json` in the recording's folder like:

```json
{
  "unmapped_speakers": ["SPEAKER_00", "SPEAKER_01", "SPEAKER_02"],
  "participants": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dave", "Eve"],
  "auto_mapping": {}
}
```

Fill it in manually:

```json
{
  "manual_mapping": {
    "SPEAKER_00": "Alice",
    "SPEAKER_01": "Carol",
    "SPEAKER_02": "Eve"
  }
}
```

Then pick the recording from the **Archive** list and re-run
**Transcribe selected**.

## The standalone `.exe`

After your first successful launch, build it once:

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -Build
```

That produces:

```
<repo>\dist\Mynah\Mynah.exe
```

- Build time: ~10 min (PyInstaller has to package torch + CUDA DLLs).
- Folder size: ~4 GB. The `.exe` is small — the bulk is sibling DLLs.
- Alongside the `.exe` you also get `SBOM.json` (CycloneDX 1.5) and
  `DLL_MANIFEST.json` — a full inventory of the Python dependencies and
  the bundled native binaries, so the 4 GB of DLLs can actually be
  audited rather than taken on trust. Regenerate either against an
  existing `dist/` without a full rebuild:
  `python build.py --sbom-only` or `python build.py --dll-manifest-only`.
- Move/copy the whole `Mynah` folder anywhere (e.g.
  `C:\Apps\Mynah\`), then right-click `Mynah.exe` →
  **Create shortcut** → drag to Desktop or pin to Taskbar.
- Settings (`config.json`) and the `Recordings\` folder both live next to
  the `.exe`. Move the whole `Mynah\` folder anywhere and it stays
  fully self-contained — no leftover state in `%APPDATA%` or registry.
- The dev launcher (`.\start.ps1` / `run.py`) keeps its own `config.json`
  and `Recordings\` folder at the project root, separate from the built
  `.exe`'s. Copy them across if you want to share state.

Model weights (~1.6 GB for Whisper, ~40 MB for pyannote) are **not** in the
build — they download to `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\` on first
transcription and stay cached after that.

                                2. align()       — per-word start/end timestamps
                                3. assign_word_speakers() — labels each WORD
                              against either the Discord speaking_events
                              intervals (PRIMARY) or pyannote acoustic
                              diarization (FALLBACK, when speaking_events are
                              absent — older recordings or non-Discord audio).
                              The transcript writer then splits each Whisper
                              segment into per-speaker sub-blocks so cross-talk
                              inside a single 10–30 s Whisper segment doesn't
                              flatten onto one label.
                              Auto-bundles ffmpeg via imageio-ffmpeg so no
                              system install is needed.
```

No bot joins the call. No audio ever leaves the machine. Nothing on
Discord's side can tell you're recording.

## Troubleshooting

> **Reporting a bug?** The app keeps a week of rotating logs — click the
> folder icon in the **Console** card header (or look in `logs\` next to
> the app) and attach the latest `mynah.log` to your issue. Logs contain
> no secrets and are scrubbed of spoofable characters.

### `.\start.ps1` errors with "running scripts is disabled"

Two options, in order of safety:

**Option A — one-shot bypass (recommended, narrowest scope):**

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start.ps1
```

This only affects the single script invocation. Nothing about your system
execution policy changes.

**Option B — permanent change for your user account:**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

Then re-run `.\start.ps1`. This lowers the execution policy for **every**
unsigned PowerShell script you run from now on, not just this one — so use
Option A if you're not sure what that implies.

### `python -m venv` fails

You don't have Python on PATH. Install Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13
from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>, ticking **"Add python.exe to PATH"**,
and try again.

### "WhisperX install failed (is git installed?)"

WhisperX is installed from GitHub, which needs `git` on PATH. Install from
<https://git-scm.com/download/win> and re-run `.\start.ps1`.

### "Discord is not running, or RPC pipe is unavailable"

Make sure the Discord desktop client (not the browser) is running. The
in-browser Discord doesn't expose RPC.

### "Discord rejected the OAuth token exchange (invalid_client)"

Only in the own-application mode. The Client ID or Client Secret is
incorrect. Open <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → your app
→ **OAuth2**, reset/copy the secret, save both values in Mynah Settings,
then connect again — or switch **Settings → Connect as** to the StreamKit
identity, which needs neither value.

### "Discord's StreamKit token service rejected the authorization code"

Only in the StreamKit mode. The Authorize prompt was accepted but
`streamkit.discord.com` refused to turn the code into a token. Usually
transient — connect again. If it keeps failing, Discord has changed the
StreamKit flow; check for a Mynah update.

### "RPC is not approved" / `AUTHORIZE` rejected

Only in the own-application mode (`invalid_scope` from `AUTHORIZE`).
Discord restricts the `rpc` scope to approved applications, and a newly
created application is refused before the Authorize prompt even appears.
Try the **App Testers** tab of your application in the developer portal
if it exists; otherwise switch **Settings → Connect as** to the StreamKit
identity, which is the default for exactly this reason.

### "No participants found"

You're connected to RPC but not actually in a voice channel. Join one in
Discord first, then click **Refresh**.

### CUDA: False in the sanity check

Your NVIDIA driver is too old, or you have an AMD/Intel GPU. Update the
driver via GeForce Experience and re-run `.\start.ps1`. Transcription will
fall back to CPU otherwise — works, but slow.

### App opens as a plain gray window instead of the dark UI

The app fell back to the legacy Tkinter interface because pywebview or
the WebView2 runtime isn't available. Re-run `.\start.ps1` (installs
pywebview into the venv) and, if the log mentions WebView2, install the
[Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
— it's preinstalled on Windows 11 and current Windows 10, so this
mostly affects stripped-down or very old installs.

### `Mynah.exe` crashes silently on launch

Open the spec, change `console=False` to `console=True`, rerun
`.\start.ps1 -Build`, and run the resulting `.exe` from a terminal to see
the traceback. Usually a missing hidden import — open an issue/note with
the error and it can be added to the spec.

### Force a clean reinstall

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -Force
```

Deletes the `.venv` and rebuilds from scratch. Your `config.json` and
`Recordings\` folder next to the app are untouched.

### Speaker labels are wrong / log says "Falling back to pyannote"

The app's primary path on Discord is the `SPEAKING_*` event subscription.
You should see this in the console pane when you start a recording:

```
INFO Subscribed to SPEAKING_START/STOP for channel <id>
```

If you see `SPEAKING_START subscribe failed` or `SPEAKING_STOP subscribe
failed` instead, the app falls back to acoustic diarization (heuristic,
much less reliable). Common causes:

- Your Discord application doesn't have the required scopes granted.
  Make sure you added yourself as an **App Tester** in the developer
  portal (the `rpc.voice.read` scope is gated).
- You're not joined to a voice channel before clicking **Start
  Recording**.

If the subscription works at start time but the transcript still looks
off, check the recording folder's `participants.json`:

- `speaking_events_complete: true` and `speaking_events: [ … ]`
  populated → ground truth was recorded; the transcript should be
  accurate.
- `speaking_events_complete: false` or `speaking_events: []` → the
  subscription failed mid-call or never succeeded; the pyannote fallback
  ran, and labels are best-effort.

### Diarization fails with "Cannot access gated repo"

You haven't accepted the model license. Visit
<https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1> and
<https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0> while logged in,
click **Agree and access repository** on each, then re-run
`.\start.ps1` (the prefetch step will pull the weights).

## Files saved on your machine

Everything the app itself produces lives **next to the app** — either the
project folder (when running from `start.ps1` / `run.py`) or next to
`Mynah.exe` (when running the built version).

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `.\config.json` | Non-sensitive settings only: Discord identity mode, Client ID, audio source, loopback device choice, whisper model, recordings folder. **No secrets.** |
| Windows Credential Manager, service `com.github.ba1lly.mynah` | Discord Client Secret (own-application mode only), HF token, and the cached OAuth access/refresh token — see Settings → Save to populate, or Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials to audit. |
| `.\Recordings\` | All `.wav`, `.json`, `.txt` outputs (configurable in Settings) |
| `.\.venv\` | Python virtual environment (dev mode only) |
| `.\dist\Mynah\` | Built standalone application (after `start.ps1 -Build`); contains its own (non-secret) `config.json` + `Recordings\` |
| `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\` | Cached Whisper + pyannote model weights — shared system-wide because they're large (~1.6 GB) |
| `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\torch\hub\checkpoints\` | Cached WhisperX word-alignment model (~80 MB per language) |

## Privacy & legal

- All audio capture and transcription is local. Nothing is uploaded.
- Outbound network traffic, exhaustively: the OAuth code-for-token
  exchange with Discord — `streamkit.discord.com/overlay/token` in the
  default StreamKit mode, `discord.com/api/oauth2/token` when using your
  own application (HTTPS either way) — model-weight downloads on
  first transcription from `huggingface.co`, and — if you leave
  **Settings → Check for updates** enabled (default) — one request per
  launch to GitHub's releases API to see whether a newer version
  exists. The update check sends nothing beyond the HTTP request
  itself and can be turned off.
- Recording laws still apply on the real-world side. In two-party-consent
  jurisdictions, inform participants.
